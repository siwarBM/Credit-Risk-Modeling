Credit risk is the risk that a borrower will not reimburse all or part of its credit on the due dates stipulated in the contract signed between the borrower and the lender.
##
The purpose of measuring credit risk is to assess the probability of default by a borrower.

##
Technique allows to transform qualitative information (age, address, income, marital status ...) into quantified and quantified data. The scoring allows to give a precise idea of the repayment capacity of an individual through the note which is produced and qualifies as information-result as opposed to the information which is entered for processing.

I Create a LightGBM model for credit risk classification for an individual.
#
Light GBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithm.
#
How lightGBM differs from other tree based algorithm?
#
**Light GBM grows tree vertically while other algorithm grows trees horizontally meaning that Light GBM grows tree leaf-wise while other algorithm grows level-wise.<br/>
**It will choose the leaf with max delta loss to grow.<br/>
**When growing the same leaf, Leaf-wise algorithm can reduce more loss than a level-wise algorithm.<br/>
